# For CosmosDB, you would need:
# azure-cosmos
# For advanced community detection like Leiden, you might need:
# graspologic (Note: This can be complex to install and might have specific numpy/scipy versions. For simplicity, we'll use NetworkX's built-in community detection or a custom one if needed.)
